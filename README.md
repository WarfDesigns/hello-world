# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
In this file I am supposed to write a bit about myself; however, it does not specify what to write about in detail. So I will say that I am a father with 5 kids and I have my own business. I host websites, design websites, code, graphic design work, videography work, repair computers, and install security cameras. My website is www.warfdesigns.com. It's not exactly how I want it yet - but that's because I spend most of my time trying to get clients.
